# Lemma B3 (PROOFS.md entry 12): the settled band has no long white run (Local, 2026-10-10)

Rule 30 on configurations ℤ → Bool with a leftmost black cell e at time 0; diagonal j at time t is the cell
e - t + j (as in LemmaB1.lean). Lemma B3: if the row at time t agrees with the row at time t - P (P ≥ 1) on the
diagonals up to M, then every white run [g + 1, M'] of row t with M' ≤ M and diagonal g black has M' - g ≤ 2P.
`lemma_B3_sharp` improves this to M' - g ≤ 2P - 1 (Local, 2026-10-10, after Cloud's CL169 sample never reached 2P).

The proof is entry 12's. One step back, a white run bounded on the left by a black cell is either older (white two
cells wider, with black two cells further left) or newborn (black on [g - 1, M' - 2]), by the constraint
D_(k-2) = D_(k-1) or D_k that a white cell imposes on the row before. The older chain cannot reach back P steps,
because the row P steps back equals the row now and is black at g. Forward from t - P the run only shrinks by two
cells a step from its left side, and at the run's birth it must clear the black range, which bounds its width. The
sharp form also uses the newborn case's black cell at M' - 1 or M', which the forward white range must miss.

How to check: as for TheoremA.lean; the `#print axioms` lines must list no `sorryAx`.
