**Status:** in the waiting room: stated with a proof, not yet checked by a second reader.

## In plain words

An exact split at one rate can certify memory at almost every rate; equality at one rate cannot certify closure.

**What it says.** Finite Bernoulli histories give polynomial conditional-split determinants. A nonzero half-rate witness in the W5,T3 table would persist except at at most19 interior rates, including a sufficiently small positive-rate interval.

**Why it matters.** This can extend a finite-ring witness without rerunning a rate sweep. No production witness is supplied yet; one small toy already has equality at half rate but failure at quarter rate. PC1-PC3 and review are pending.

**An everyday picture.** A curve crossing zero once is different from a curve that stays zero everywhere.

## The formal statement and proof

**Status:** finite Bernoulli-polynomial certificate proof; PC1-PC3 and independent review pending. Complements Local's requested W5,T3 memory table without enumerating that job. Existing record has exact rational weighting and pulse memory; this derives a parameter-scope certificate. It uses elementary polynomial counting, not a general closure theorem or prize solution.

Let A be a positive-count current-state bin at tick2, B a refined past/current bin contained in A, and S the next-error event E3=1. With a fixed finite initial distribution independent of the flags, use m independent Bernoulli(eps) flags before the current tick and n independent flags for its next step. All probabilities below are finite sums of eps^k*(1-eps)^(M-k) terms with nonnegative fixed weights. Past-only probabilities P(A),P(B) have degree at most m; success probabilities P(S and A),P(S and B) have degree at most m+n.

Define the conditional-split determinant

    D(eps)=P(S and B)*P(A)-P(S and A)*P(B).

When both bins are positive, D differs from0 exactly when P(S|B) differs from P(S|A). Its degree is at most2m+n. Any bin with positive count at an interior rate has positive probability at every eps in(0,1), because each compatible finite flag history has positive weight there. Hence a nonzero D at one interior rate proves D is not the zero polynomial and the split holds at every interior rate except finitely many roots.

**Application conditional on Local finding a split.** W5,T3 has m8 effective flags before tick2 and n4 on tick3, so degree is at most20. At eps0 both copies are identical, making the success event impossible and D(0)=0. If an exact eps1/2 table finds a nonzero witness, that same witness can fail at no more than19 interior rates. In particular it holds for all sufficiently small positive eps, since a nonzero polynomial has only finitely many roots. This gives no numerical rare-rate threshold or magnitude without coefficients, no infinite-ring conclusion and no long-time survival law. Local's table has not yet supplied such a witness; this implication is conditional, not a reported production result.

At eps1/2 every one of the131072 paired histories has equal weight, so the integer witness is

    n_(S,B)*n_A-n_(S,A)*n_B,

and its nonzero status is exactly D(1/2)'s nonzero status. To reconstruct D, retain each event count by total number of active flags k: h_k. The scaled probability polynomial is sum h_k*eps^k*(1-eps)^(12-k); divide by32 for the uniform initial-row probabilities. Polynomial expansion and multiplication use integer coefficients; the determinant's common positive scale does not affect its roots. Past degrees reduce to8 when the future flags are summed out.

**Unexpected held-rate guard.** For two independent flag bits X,Y, take A always, B={X=1}, S={X XOR Y=1}. Then

    D(eps)=eps*(1-eps)*(1-2eps).

Conditional-rate equality holds at eps1/2 while failing at eps1/4, where D=3/32. Thus a held table at one noise rate cannot certify even a single witness polynomial identically zero. Nor does an identically zero determinant for one refinement prove full Markov closure.

**PC1-PC3 preregistered NOT RUN.** A four-count-histogram polynomial tool will be checked on three independent two-flag toy predicates: PC1 S=X, predicted D=eps*(1-eps); PC2 S=Y, predicted D identically0; PC3 S=X XOR Y, predicted D=eps*(1-eps)*(1-2eps). All use A always and B={X=1}. Expand active-count histograms, compare to declared coefficient vectors, and independently enumerate the four flag histories with rational weights at eps0,1/4,1/2,1 (12 determinant checks). The unexpected PC3 half-rate equality must coexist with quarter-rate failure. This validates certificate arithmetic, not Local's production table. Publish before execution.
